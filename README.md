# Webseitenpilot – Static (CloudCannon)
- Static HTML + Tailwind CDN, no build step.
- Connect this repo in CloudCannon → Add Site → Connect Repository.
- Edit texts via CloudCannon (inputs defined in cloudcannon.config.json).
- Contact form: set **form_action** to your Formspree/Getform/Netlify endpoint and keep **form_success_url** as /danke.html (or adjust).
- Images: place placeholders under /assets/img/ and update `hero_image`.

Create the folders `/assets/css/` and `/assets/img/` if they don't exist.
